# desktop-search-engine

This is a java implementation of a basic desktop search engine.
We have used java Swing and Derby.

Just add directories you want to add to DB (like C:\, D:\ or subdirectories). 
It will  take a minute.

After than you can search for any file or folder just by entering a 
substring from the name and optionally an extension.

We have designed the search to be lightening fast.
You can get the results instantly. 
We also cache the recently searched results for faster retreival.

We are also working on adding search by content using Lucene.
